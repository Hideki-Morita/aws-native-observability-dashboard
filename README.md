## 🪩 Overview

The <mark>**AWS Native Cross-account Observability Dashboard**</mark> is composed of three parts and integrates seamlessly with **the AWS Management Console** (🔴CloudWatch Logs Insights / 🔴CloudTrail / 🔵X-Ray).  

- The **🚀AWS Configuration Management** provides deep insights into Identity and Access Management within a complex AWS environment using a multi-account strategy.  
- **Centralized Monitoring for AWS Services**:
  - The **🚀AWS Serverless Overview** / **🚀AWS Serverless Observability Monitoring👀** offer deep insights into the **AWS Serverless World**, based on the principles of <mark>Cloud Native Observability theory</mark> (Logs, Metrics (RED/USE patterns), Traces, Service maps, etc.).[^2]

### ☻ The #AWSAlwaysFreeChallenge

This project, as part of the <mark>**#AWSAlwaysFreeChallenge**</mark>, is dedicated to driving innovation through <mark>**no-cost**</mark>(Pay-As-You-Go), open-source solutions.  
By leveraging advanced techniques and open-source tools, we aim to provide <u>alternatives that match or even surpass the functionality</u> of expensive **AWS premium services** (often costing $4-5 digits per month)[^3]🥲, such as Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon Athena, and Managed Grafana.  
Our goal is to empower companies and developers with high-performance, cost-efficient solutions that deliver robust cloud observability without the financial burden of premium pricing.

|🔴**API Gateway Request and Error Monitoring:**  |- **Track Recent API Gateway Requests**: View the latest _300_ API Gateway requests with detailed metadata, including IP addresses, request methods, and response statuses.<br>- **Error Analytics**: Spot errors (4xx and 5xx) instantly, with the ability to drill down into error details for troubleshooting.|
|🟠**AWS Lambda Deep Insights:**   |- **Track Recent Lambda Executions**: Examine detailed logs for the most recent Lambda invocations, including execution status, request ID, and X-Ray trace information.<br>- **Enhanced Lambda Debugging**: Easily filter and find Lambda execution logs tied to specific API requests using `correlation IDs` from API Gateway and `trace IDs`.|
|🔵**AWS X-Ray Trace Monitoring:** |- **Real-time Trace Visualization**: Get a complete visual breakdown of API Gateway requests and Lambda invocations using X-Ray traces. Trace the path of a request as it moves through API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB using `Service Map`.<br>- **Detailed Latency Breakdown**: Understand the latency of each service involved in a transaction, helping you identify performance bottlenecks at a glance with the `Flame Graph`.|
|**Centralized 🔴CloudTrail Logs:** |- **Cross-Service Correlation**: Track recent AWS API requests. Easily identify and troubleshoot issues across multiple services, including who called the API and from where.|
